  The Lab consisted of 3 separate malware that all did something different. For this lab, I chose to take a look at the first malware hash of 068D5B62254DC582F3697847C16710B7. <br><br>

  I set up the malware and the tools like Fakenet, Explorer monitor, Explorer process, and others and then ran the malware. It seemed to run a foreign program because the name was in what I believe was chinese. I could be wrong about that though, Iâ€™m not exactly sure. <br><br>

  Judging from the cuckoo logs that were created after running the malware, The program was trying to request keys and failing. I then found that it downloaded a file called wm.ime which I was really confused with so I went back to the cuckoo logs. I then found that the malware read a couple files in my C:Windows directory and then created a batch script titled del770ae.bat. This file deletes itself and the initial malware file when executed. I then looked back through the logs and found that it adds to a specific file in my keyboard layout directory and this made me realize that the malware was a keylogger. <br><br>

<p>
  My final analysis of this malware is that it is a keylogger that reads and adds files to you keyboard settings. Then writes a script that deletes its own files to make it harder to catch. I do not know exactly what the changes to the keyboard settings do, but I would assume they trigger some sort of external search and download. The best way to see if you have this malware on your own device would be to check for the wm.ime file that it creates. Deleting that would disrupt the malware. It would also be best to look over your keyboard layout files and delete any extra file it may have created.
