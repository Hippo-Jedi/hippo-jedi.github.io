        <h6>Malware Defense</h6>
<p>This week's module talks a lot about how to defend against malware compared to the other modules. The module discusses Defense graphs, attack vectors, Yara signatures, Cuckoo, other topics involving the defense against malware.
</p>

<h6>Attack Graph</h6>
<p>
  The attack graph is a general overview of the process and stages malware goes through:<br><br>
First contact: This is generally how Malware gets into a machine. There are various ways malware does this like simple email attachments to a USB stick. One specific term discussed was ‘Watering hole’, which basically is targeting a resource that is widely used. This is used a lot when a company is the main target for the malware. <br><br>
Local Execution: Once the code is on the machine, it has to be executed. There are three primary ways to do this:<br><br>
Social Engineering: Tricking the user into executing the code.<br><br>

Exploiting a bug: This is more general attacks like buffer overflow.<br><br>

Exploiting a feature: This is when a specific feature is used to execute the code. A good example of this is Windows autorun feature which automatically runs code on a CD.<br><br>

Establish Presence: This is when the malware code is running but hasn’t done anything that is permanent. At this stage, the malware could be detected or wiped from the machine so hiding itself is very important. This involves creating filenames with common names or installing with operating system files. Another example of how malware can hide are bootkits/rootkits. This malware infects the bootloader and lies to programs about files and processes that are being run. This allows for the malware to hide itself from being executed. This activity can persist by altering the machine to execute the malware on startup or by using side-loading so that the malware is run in conjunction with another program. <br><br>
Malicious Activity: This is the final stage a malware can get to. This is basically when the malware does what it was intended to do like steal data and other malicious activities. 
</p>

<h6>Anti-Malware</h6>
<p>
  The second stage or the ‘local execution’ is the easiest stage to detect and block malware. An example would be anti-malware searching for known malware and stopping it from executing at stage 2. Traditional anti-malware has many features like file scanning, registry and cookies, memory scanning, decomposition, and general scripts. The best way to defend a machine from malware is to have defenses set up at each stage. This would reduce the overall likelihood of a malware getting all the way through. <br><br>
  
Yara is a rule engine that can be used similarly to the rule engines used by anti-malware. Here is the Yara syntax for creating a rule: <br><br>

<p>
  - Strings: This section would be considered the body of the rule and defines any patterns that need to be followed. It is best not to over complicate this section to keep the rule concise. <br><br>
- Conditions: This section defines the boolean statement to determine whether or not the string is followed.<br><br>
